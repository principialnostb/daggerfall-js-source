// HARBOUR-BOOK (2026-10-04, from the field: the port towns' new docks "missing" for some players) - THE HARBOURS FOUND
// NEAR THE PLAYER, ONE BOOK FOR THE QUAYS AND THE SEA. SHIP-LIFE's harbours (shipLife.js findHarbour) were the naval
// host's own Map, sounded in its frame alone - and that frame runs only while Naval Combat and Come Sail Away do, so a
// player with either off stood no quay in any port. A port's quays are its town's, not the sea fight's: the harbours are
// kept here, the world host sounds them every exterior frame whatever runs on the water, and the quays
// (scenes/quayPool.js) and the naval host (its moored ships, its docking, its errands) read the same book.
//
// ITS LIFE (navalHost.js harbourFrame's, moved whole): the port town within a pixel of the player (`harbourNear` - its
// key, its name, its footprint in the scene now and whether every pixel the sounding reads is built) is sounded once
// that ground is built (AUDIT HOLDINGS O1: a pixel not built reads as land); a port that gave no harbour is sounded again
// HARBOUR_RETRY_S later (AUDIT SHIP-LIFE B7); the berths move with the floating origin (`offsetAll`), and the book is
// emptied at a transition, a jump and a load (`clear`) - found again where the world is next. A naval host made without
// a book (its tests) keeps one of its own and steps it in its frame, as before.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (QUAYS).
